# Bank Churn Prediction

Predicting bank churn (customer attrition) using machine learning to help banks retain customers and improve customer satisfaction.

## Overview

Bank Churn Prediction is a data science project aimed at identifying customers who are likely to leave the bank based on historical data and customer attributes. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we can predict churn probability, allowing banks to take proactive measures to retain customers and mitigate revenue loss.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains historical data of bank customers, including demographics, account information, transaction history, and churn status. It is anonymized and contains features such as age, gender, account balance, credit score, and customer tenure.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the dataset, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.

2. **Feature Engineering:** Create new features, extract meaningful insights, and select relevant features to improve model performance.

3. **Model Selection:** Experiment with various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, and neural networks.

4. **Model Training:** Train the selected models on the preprocessed data and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tune model hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search to optimize performance.

6. **Model Evaluation:** Assess model performance using cross-validation and validation set, analyze feature importance, and interpret model predictions.

## Results

Our predictive models achieved promising results with an accuracy of [insert accuracy here] and a [insert other relevant metric]. The most important features contributing to churn prediction were [list important features]. Further analysis revealed insights into customer behavior and churn drivers.

## Usage

1. **Installation:** Clone the repository and install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. **Training:** Run the Jupyter notebook `bank_churn_prediction.ipynb` to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.

3. **Prediction:** Use trained models to predict churn probability for new customer data or deploy the model in a real-time application.
