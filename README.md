## Project 1: Bank Churn Modelling

**Description:** A bank churn prediction project involves using machine learning techniques, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), to predict whether customers are likely to leave a bank (churn) based on various factors such as demographics, transaction history, customer interactions, etc. The aim is to identify customers at risk of churning so that proactive measures can be taken to retain them, such as offering targeted promotions or improving customer service.

**Features:**
- Transaction frequency: Indicates engagement and loyalty.
- Customer age: Different age groups may have varying churn tendencies.
- Customer service interactions: High interactions may signal dissatisfaction.
- Account balance: Changes could reflect financial stability and satisfaction.

**Technologies Used:**    
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Pandas / NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks / IDEs

**Code:** [Bank Churn Modelling](https://github.com/Geo107/Machine-Learning/)

## Project 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection

**Description:** This project is used to detect credit card fraud using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM). The SOM algorithm is employed to identify patterns and anomalies in credit card transactions that may indicate fraudulent activities.

**Features:**
- Transaction Amount: Detects unusual spending patterns, possibly indicating fraudulent activity.
- Transaction Frequency: Unusual frequency or sudden changes may signal fraudulent behavior.
- Location: Anomalies in transaction locations could indicate fraudulent use of stolen cards.
- Time of Transaction: Unusual transaction times may reveal fraudulent activity, such as late-night or early-morning purchases.

**Technologies Used:**     
- Python
- Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)   
- Data manipulation libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy)
- Visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)

**Code:** [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/Geo107/Machine-Learning/)

## Project 3: Google Stock Price Prediction

**Description:** Brief description of the project. Mention its purpose, dataset used, and key techniques applied.
