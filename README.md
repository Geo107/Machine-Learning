## Project 1: Bank Churn Modelling

**Description:** A bank churn prediction project involves using machine learning techniques, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), to predict whether customers are likely to leave a bank (churn) based on various factors such as demographics, transaction history, customer interactions, etc. The aim is to identify customers at risk of churning so that proactive measures can be taken to retain them, such as offering targeted promotions or improving customer service.

**Features:**
- Transaction frequency: Indicates engagement and loyalty.
- Customer age: Different age groups may have varying churn tendencies.
- Customer service interactions: High interactions may signal dissatisfaction.
- Account balance: Changes could reflect financial stability and satisfaction.

**Technologies Used:**    
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Pandas / NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks / IDEs

**Code:** [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Geo107/Machine-Learning/Bank-Churn-Modelling)
